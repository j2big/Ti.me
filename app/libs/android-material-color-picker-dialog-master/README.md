## HOW TO USE IT

### Adding the library to your project
The aar artifact is available at the **jcenter** repository. Declare the repository and the
dependency in your `build.gradle`.
    
(root)
```groovy
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
```
    
(module)
```groovy    
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.pes.materialcolorpicker:library:1.0.+'
    }
```

### Use the library

Import the class
```java
    import com.pes.androidmaterialcolorpickerdialog.ColorPicker;
```

Create a color picker dialog object

```java
    final ColorPicker cp = new ColorPicker(MainActivity.this, defaultColorR, defaultColorG, defaultColorB);
```

defaultColorR, defaultColorG, defaultColorB are 3 integer ( value 0-255) for the initialization of the color picker with your custom color value. If you don't want to start with a color set them to 0 or use only the first argument

Then show the dialog (when & where you want) and save the selected color

```java

    /* Show color picker dialog */
    cp.show();
    
    /* On Click listener for the dialog, when the user select the color */
    Button okColor = (Button)cp.findViewById(R.id.okColorButton);
        okColor.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                
                /* You can get single channel (value 0-255) */
                selectedColorR = cp.getRed();
                selectedColorG = cp.getGreen();
                selectedColorB = cp.getBlue();
                
                /* Or the android RGB Color (see the android Color class reference) */
                selectedColorRGB = cp.getColor();

                cp.dismiss();
            }
        });
```

That's all :)
